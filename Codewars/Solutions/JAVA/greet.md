Returning Strings

Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

**Solution:**
```java
public class Kata
{
  public static String greet(String name)
  {
      System.out.print("Input name: ");

      return "Hello, " + name + " how are you doing today?";
  }
}
```
